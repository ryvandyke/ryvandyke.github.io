        <h3>About Me</h3>
       <p>My name is <b>Ryan VanDyke</b>. I currently live in Liberty, Missouri, with my
wife and daughter. I have been a high school educator for 21 years,
teaching theatre and film. I completed my undergraduate degree at
Baker University in Baldwin City, Kansas, in 1998 with a degree in
education and theatre. </p>
<p>This summer, I began my Master's program
and will graduate in the Spring of 2023. <br/> My long-term goals include
teaching at the high school level and expanding my professional
design resume by working with local theatre companies during the
summer.</p>
