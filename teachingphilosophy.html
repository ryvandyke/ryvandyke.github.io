    <h2>Teaching Philosophy </h2>
    My Philosophy of Teaching begins with the idea that my class is about my students. Good teachers try to connect
    with their students by developing trust and understanding every day. This process is the best way to engage the
    student in the learning process. Teaching begins as soon as the students enter the room. I always try to meet
    the
    students as they walk into my room. It establishes a positive atmosphere, and it helps me measure how the
    students
    feel before I start the lesson for the day.
    <p style="margin-left:50px;">Over the last twenty-one years, I have developed a series of small summative ways
      to
      measure each learner in class. It is not fair to judge students in the classroom based on the highest or
      lowest
      skilled student. A good teacher is always looking for ways to measure growth and progress for each student
      based
      on their ability and past performances.</p>
    <p style="margin-left:50px;">Within the Theatre Arts / Media Curriculum, the students are challenged to access
      and
      develop their imagination to express themselves creatively. I believe in project-based collaborative learning,
      where you can allow the student to push themselves in their week areas while also finding and building
      confidence
      in the areas and skills they are strong in.</p>
    <p style="margin-left:50px;">Beyond the standard content, I believe in what Kitt Lavole termed the collaborative
      world of theatre.
      <br>
    <p style="margin-left:50px;">Lavole stated that
    <h4>"the most important lesson that student artists must learn is beyond becoming the kind of talent that people
      want to work with â€“ they must also become the kind of
      person that people want to work with."</h4>
    <p style="margin-left:50px;">In my class, we learn to support and encourage one another.</p>
