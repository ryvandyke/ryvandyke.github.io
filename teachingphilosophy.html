    <h2>Teaching Philosophy </h2>
    My Philosophy of Teaching begins with the idea that my class is about my students. Good teachers try to connect
    with their students by developing trust and understanding every day. This process is the best way to engage the
    student in the learning process. Teaching begins as soon as the students enter the room. I always try to meet
    the
    students as they walk into my room. It establishes a positive atmosphere, and it helps me measure how the
    students
    feel before I start the lesson for the day.
    Over the last twenty-one years, I have developed a series of small summative ways
    to
    measure each learner in class. It is not fair to judge students in the classroom based on the highest or
    lowest
    skilled student. A good teacher is always looking for ways to measure growth and progress for each student
    based
    on their ability and past performances.
    Within the Theatre Arts / Media Curriculum, the students are challenged to access
    and
    develop their imagination to express themselves creatively. I believe in project-based collaborative learning,
    where you can allow the student to push themselves in their week areas while also finding and building
    confidence
    in the areas and skills they are strong in.
    Beyond the standard content, I believe in what Kitt Lavole termed the collaborative
    world of theatre.
    <br>
    <p> Lavole stated that</p>
    <h4>"the most important lesson that student artists must learn is beyond becoming the kind of talent that people
      want to work with â€“ they must also become the kind of
      person that people want to work with."</h4>

    <p>In my class, we learn to support and encourage one another.</p>
