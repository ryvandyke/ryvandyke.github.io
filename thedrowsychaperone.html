            <h2>The Drowsy Chaperone - Musical</h2>
            <h4>Pre production design sketches and descriptions</h4>

            My designs were based around creating a 1940's New York apartment for a lonely man obsessed with musical
            theatre. The
            setting is an example of a modified Unit set. I used the apartment as the primary location. During the
            musical, each
            section of the apartment (i.e., the kitchen, dressing area, and bedroom/bookcase became a separate
            performance space
            when needed. The props used on the set were essential to the apartment's aesthetics; however, they also had
            to be
            functional as secondary props to the story within a story. The standard new york loft style of the design
            matched the
            character's personality and the general theme of the production.
            <h4>Post production photographs and evaluation</h4>
            Evaluation of Designs: Using the Principles of Art
            The unifying theme of the design - Musical Theatre obsessed, lonely, and overdramatic.

            Balance - Like the main character himself. The design was very eclectic and off-balance, showcasing the
            musicals out of
            control and whimsical theme.
            Alignment- Although the set was out of balance, the organization of the apartment was immaculate and
            detailed.
            Emphasis - The design focused on the main character's red chair on the stage right side of the design. This
            design
            choice allowed the audience's attention to stay on the main character even when other things were happening
            on stage.
            Lighting was also used to direct the audience's focus and was very effective in changing locations quickly
            during the
            production.
            Movement - Matching the quirkiness of the staging, the movement on the set was free-flowing.
            Pattern - Simple shapes were used throughout the design to match the main character's style and the broadway
            musical
            theme of the show.
            Contrast - The design element that was the most different was the dreamlike structure that entered the
            apartment center
            stage during the end of the 1st Act. This was a flower-laced garden tower that allowed multiple levels and
            action to
            happen within the apartment.
