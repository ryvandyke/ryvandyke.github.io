            <h2>Anything Goes - Musical</h2>
            <h4>Pre production design sketches and descriptions</h4>


            Description: My designs were based around creating a 1920's passenger ship. The setting is an example of a
            Unit set.
            Using the ship's center as a separate performance space, I created an interior space such as a stateroom and
            a nightclub. The props used on the set matched the motif of the time period and were designed to be
            functional
            yet lightweight and moveable by performers. The art deco-inspired style of the designs matched the
            characters'
            personalities and the general theme of the production.
            <h4>Post production photographs and evaluation</h4>
            Evaluation of Designs: Using the Principles of Art

            The unifying theme of the design - Art deco style and 1920s overindulgence
            Balance - The ship was very symmetrical from left to right and front to back. Most of the staging happened
            on the main
            stage level; however, each level of the ship needed to be constructed to hold at least 15 people.
            Alignment- Matching the art deco style of the 1920's the alignment was vital in creating the layered tiered
            look
            synonymous with the time. Emphasis - The design focused on the center of the stage. This design choice
            allowed the
            action to change location within the ship by opening up two sliding set units (located on the main stage
            level in the
            ship's center), revealing an open space that allowed other scenic elements to be added or flown in. Lighting
            was also
            used to direct the audience's focus and was very effective in changing locations quickly during the
            production.
            Movement - Matching the fast-paced antics and action, the movement of the set allowed for quick and easy
            access to any
            part of the stage from the off-stage areas.
            Pattern - Simple shapes were used throughout the design to match the art deco style. The design was based on
            function
            and safety. Contrast - The element of the stage that was the most different was the stack at the upstage
            center section
            of the design. This was a featured element in order to create the look of a ship from this tim
