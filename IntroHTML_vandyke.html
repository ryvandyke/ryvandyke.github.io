     Hello, my name is Ryan VanDyke.  Over the last 21 years, I have taught High School Theatre and Media in Saint Joseph, Missouri.  My wife of 27 years and I have one daughter.  She is a Senior at K-State and will graduate in December.  Over the summer, we are beginning a new chapter in our lives as we move to Liberty, Missouri.  I accepted a new job as the Theatre Teacher at Liberty North High School and will begin in the fall.   I have developed and maintained a website for my Theatre program for the last 4 years using the GoDaddy WYSIWYG platform.  I am interested in learning how to code a web page.  I would like to develop my skills to provide a better web experience for my students. Outside of school, you will find me fly-fishing in Montana and enjoying the fantastic views of our national parks.
