      <h2>Big FIsh - Musical</h2>
      <h4>Basic show synopsis</h4>
      Edward Bloom has lived a full and fantastical life, populated by witches, giants, and mermaids, marked by true
      love that
      stops time in its tracks, and framed by heroics that push the limits of believability. His adult son, Will, is no
      longer
      amused by his father’s fantastical tales, insisting on a rational rather than a fantastical account of one’s
      life. When Edward’s health declines, and Will learns that he and his wife, Josephine, will have a son of their
      own, Will
      decides to find out his father’s “true” life story, once and for all. Big Fish is a heartfelt, powerful, and truly
      magical musical about fathers, sons, and the stories that we use to define our identities. With spine-tinglingly
      beautiful music and lyrics by Andrew Lippa, and a funny, heartwarming book by John August, Big Fish is a
      magnificent
      “big fish” of a tale, itself -- spectacular, fantastical, and overflowing with love.

      <h2>The Drowsy Chaperone - Musical</h2>
      <h4>Basic show synopsis</h4>
      When wealthy widow Mrs. Tottenham hosts the wedding of the year, she gets a lot more than a write-up in the
      society
      pages: Janet Van de Graaff, glittering starlet of Feldzieg’s Follies, is leaving the stage for love, a turn of
      events
      which horrifies the angry and anxious Mr. Feldzieg, whose chief investor has sent two gangsters disguised as
      pastry
      chefs to make sure he stops the wedding. Hiring Aldolpho, a Latin lover more vain than virile, to seduce the
      bride, is
      unsuccessful, as Janet’s chaperone, a drunken diva, gets herself mistaken for the bride and seduced in Janet’s
      place. It
      is left to the eager best man, George, to quite by accident break up the happy pair, when he sends groom Robert
      Martin
      out to the garden, blindfolded, and in roller skates. Such are the antics of The Drowsy Chaperone, a fictitious
      1928
      musical comedy. This magical piece of meta-theatre and playful, heartfelt parody of the 1920s musical comedy
      features a
      chirpy jazz age score by Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison, and a lively, clever book by Bob Martin and Don McKellar,
      both
      of which were Tony winners in 2006. The score boasts such tunes as the scenery-chomping “Show Off”, the sizzling
      and
      silly “I Am Aldolpho”, the double-entendre laden “Toledo Surprise”, and “As We Stumble Along”, that rousing anthem
      to
      optimistic alcoholism.

      <h2>Anything Goes - Musical</h2>
      <h4>Basic show synopsis</h4>
      The S. S. American is sailing between New York and England with a comically colorful assemblage of passengers:
      Reno
      Sweeney, a popular nightclub singer and former evangelist, her pal Billy Crocker, a lovelorn Wall Street broker
      who has
      come aboard to try to win the favor of his beloved Hope Harcourt (who is engaged to another passenger, Sir Evelyn
      Oakleigh), and a second-rate conman named Moonface Martin, aka “Public Enemy #13.” Song, dance, and farcical
      antics
      ensue as Reno and Moonface try to help Billy win the love of his life.
