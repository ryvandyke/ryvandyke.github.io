            <h3>Big Fish Design</h3>
            2017 - Big FIsh - Musical
            Basic show synopsis
            Edward Bloom has lived a full and fantastical life, populated by witches, giants, and mermaids, marked by
            true
            love that stops time in its tracks, and framed by heroics that push the limits of believability. His adult
            son,
            Will, is no longer amused by his father’s fantastical tales, insisting on a rational rather than a
            fantastical
            account of one’s
            life. When Edward’s health declines, and Will learns that he and his wife, Josephine, will have a son of
            their
            own, Will decides to find out his father’s “true” life story, once and for all. Big Fish is a heartfelt,
            powerful,
            and truly magical musical about fathers, sons, and the stories that we use to define our identities. With
            spine-tinglingly beautiful music and lyrics by Andrew Lippa, and a funny, heartwarming book by John August,
            Big
            Fish is a magnificent “big fish” of a tale, itself -- spectacular, fantastical, and overflowing with love.

            <h3>Pre production design sketches and descriptions</h3>
            My designs were based on creating a world centered around the stories of Edward Bloom. The design is an
            example of
            a presentational set. The scenic elements move around and fly in and out, constantly changing the location
            and
            feel of the show. The design matched the style and feel of the southern United States of the 1940s and 1950s
            and
            the simple feel of a small-town boy as he lived an extraordinary life. This show used a false proscenium
            that
            created an outline around the stage opening. This design element was made to look like old barn wood and
            provided
            the ambiance that set the stage and matched the show's motif.

            <h3>Post production photographs and evaluation</h3>
            Evaluation of Designs: Using the Principles of Art
            The unifying theme of the design - larger than life storytelling, with love and family at the center
            Balance - The entire design was staged in the center between the false proscenium.
            Alignment- The design was aligned from left to right across the stage. The two structures on stage right and
            left
            were the bookends to the life of Edward Bloom, and the story unfolded between them.
            Emphasis - As the settings moved from location to location, the center of the stage was always the focus
            Movement - The movement of the design flowed with the show. Most of the scenic elements and props were flown
            in on
            moved on by characters.

            Pattern - Faith and family were represented in every aspect of the design and repeated in large and small
            detail.
            Contrast - The false proscenium was the scenic element that always brought the story back to the main
            character's
            roots. It was the one constant of the set that moved and shifted throughout the musical.
